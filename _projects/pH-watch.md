We developed "pH watch" - consisting of a custom-made sweat pH sensor and a very low-compute pH sensing algorithm which can be easily integrated into existing fitness trackers or smartwatches which already have a built-in pulse oximeter. 
pH Watch can simultaneously monitor the pH value of a userâ€™s sweat, along with heart rate and blood oxygen saturation values in real-time, with about 90 per cent accuracy. This aids in real-time and non-invasive skin health and dehydration sensing. 

Our work was also published in Mobisys 2019.
